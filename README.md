## About this repo

This repo exists for me to mess with red bot cogs. That's it. If you want to use these cogs, have at it, everything here comes with the divine license of, do whatever the fuck you want with it. 

You can try asking me for help, but I'm god awful at responding. Don't bother with opening issues and whatnot, I basically only know how to upload things to github and never look at notifications.

If one of these cogs broke to the extend that you've lost a limb, life, or liberty - shoot me a message on discord **@nekojesus** after dealing with the hospital.
